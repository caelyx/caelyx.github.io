title: "RSA Conference vendors -- 2014 vs 2016"

The security market is changing, and quickly. Each year, the RSA Conference hosts tens of thousands of delegates and hundreds of security vendors. In a conversation yesterday, John Stewart suggested that it might be an interesting idea to look at how the vendor population had changed over time, to get a sense for how the security market was moving. 

To that end, the exhibitor lists are available online: [2014](http://www.rsaconference.com/events/us14/exhibitors-sponsors/exhibitor-list), [2016](http://www.rsaconference.com/events/us16/expo-sponsors/exhibitor-list). 

I've run a diff between the two years, and manually cleaned up duplicates that weren't exact matches (e.g. where an 'Inc.' suffix had been added or removed). There may, therefore, be some errors in the data; corrections welcome to the email address in the footer.

That left 151 companies that were exhibitors in 2014, who were not present in 2016. Astonishingly, 307 companies exhibiting in 2016 were not present in 2014. The full lists are below. 

Some interesting research possibilities:

* What happened to the companies that left? Are they still around, and just not exhibiting? Were they acquired (e.g. Trusteer)? How many folded, and why?
* How do the removed and new companies fit into a capability map of the security market? Can we infer useful market trends from the overall movements? Does this data help us start to model how consolidation within a category behaves, or when a category is likely to become an acquisition target by the security conglomerates? 
* The underlying data also includes each stand location -- from this, we could probably infer some signal about stand cost (e.g. the very outer edge is cheapest, and the price goes up as you move inward). It would be interesting to see the migration patterns for companies year-on-year, and whether this was correlated with anything interesting (e.g. revenue). It feels like there would be a cool chart in here. 
* Can we infer anything interesting from the intersection of the two above? e.g. does a series of new companies in the same category appearing in the outer edge in one year indicate that a smaller number will make it into the next inward ring next year? Once a company moves outward, how likely is it to be able to recover? 

Happy to contribute to a paper if anyone is interested.
