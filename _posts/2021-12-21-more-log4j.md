A few more links:

- Akamai's security team [published some interesting analysis](https://www.akamai.com/blog/security/threat-intelligence-on-log4j-cve-key-findings-and-their-implications#.YcHHLN2wkDg.twitter) of the `log4j` related traffics they're seeing across their networks. Figure 1 is titled "A mild start, then a global tsunami of malicious activity", which seems to capture the mood. 
- ZDNet has [a good primer](https://www.zdnet.com/article/log4j-flaw-10-questions-you-should-be-asking/#ftag=RSSbaffb68) for people just catching up, anchored around the [UK NCSC advice to boards](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/log4j-vulnerability-what-should-boards-be-asking). 
- Cisco Talos has a good [omnibus page](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/12/apache-log4j-rce-vulnerability.html) with lots of useful content. Their [current guidance](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/12/apache-log4j-rce-vulnerability.html#mitigations) section is a useful summary of the three vulnerabilities and what the patches do to resolve them, and they also share [examples of exploitation activity](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/12/apache-log4j-rce-vulnerability.html#exploitactivity).  
- The [Belgian Defence Ministry](https://www.zdnet.com/article/belgian-defense-ministry-confirms-cyberattack-through-log4j-exploitation/)  has announced that they were affected by an attack using `log4j`.
