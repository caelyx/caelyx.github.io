James Kendrick at ZDNet: 

<blockquote>
I have used over a dozen different Android tablets and frequent crashes/reboots have affected every single one of them. I don't know if that was the result of the earlier versions of Android or the apps I use, but it marred my enjoyment of Android tablets.

That's no longer the case with the Nexus. No app has crashed and the tablet hasn't spontaneiously rebooted while using it. It is as stable as the iPad in operation for me, and that's a big thing.
</blockquote>

Wow. I had no idea that stability was so poor on Android tablets. 

I've not used a production platform in the last five years that was that
unstable, including a Windows XP SOE. It seems extraordinary that products
that unstable were made available for purchase.
