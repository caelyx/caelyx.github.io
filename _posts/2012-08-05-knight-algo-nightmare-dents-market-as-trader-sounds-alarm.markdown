Bloomberg:

<blockquote>
Knight said today that losses from the trading breakdown are $440 million, almost quadruple its 2011 net income and more than some analysts had estimated, and the firm is exploring strategic and financial alternatives.
</blockquote>

Welcome to the brave new world of automation risk, where a trading firm can
lose four years of profit in less than an hour. It's happened a couple of
times (remember the "flash crash") in financial markets, but this is one of
the first traced to a specific entity and which threatens that entity as a
going concern. 

Independently, this is another good wake up call to consider what other
automation we have in place. As [Chris Hoff argued][1] after the flash crash: 

<blockquote>
[As] automation matures and feedback loops become more closed with higher and higher clock rates yielding less time between execution, our ability to both detect and recover — let alone prevent — within a cascading failure domain is diminished.
</blockquote>

How much of your organisation's critical compute, network, or storage is
manageable by a given automated process?
