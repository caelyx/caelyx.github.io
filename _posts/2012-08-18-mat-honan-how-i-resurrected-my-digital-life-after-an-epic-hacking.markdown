[Mat Honan has written eloquently][elink] about the he has lessons learned from his recent ordeal. Most chilling is his commentary on the processes around account management: 

<blockquote>
We don’t own our account security. And as more information about us lives online in ever more locations, we have to make sure that those we entrust it with have taken the necessary steps to keep us safe. That’s not happening now. And until it does, what happened to me could happen to you.
