In dealing with the `log4j` problem, some links that turned up in searching or that others shared: 

- Anchore's [grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype/) scans container images, JAR files, etc for known-vulnerable versions of Java packages (among other things). They also have [syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) which generates software bill of materials (SBOM) reports. (Hat tip to the ACSC for pointing to the latter.)
- [This LGTM report](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/apache/logging-log4j2/alerts/?mode=list&id=java%2Fjndi-injection) suggests Apache log4j 2.17 might still have some JNDI things to check.
- [Huntress log4j tester](https://log4shell.huntress.com/) might be useful for quickly checking your own internet-facing systems.
- @nathanqthai at [Grey Noise Intelligence](https://www.greynoise.io/) has [published examples](https://gist.github.com/nathanqthai/197b6084a05690fdebf96ed34ae84305) of attempted exploitation of the log4j vulnerability in the wild
- AWS is apparently [hotpatching their services](https://github.com/corretto/hotpatch-for-apache-log4j2), with coverage in [this advisory](https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/AWS-2021-006/)
- CyberCX NZ has a [useful article](https://blog.cybercx.co.nz/log4j-critical-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228-planning-for-the-holidays) with suggestions for how to handle the remaining marathon on `CVE-2021-44228` without burning people out.


Some other security resources:

- [CVE Trends](https://cvetrends.com/) is a quick dashboard of which CVEs people are talking about on Twitter.
- [CISA Crossfeed](https://github.com/cisagov/crossfeed) is an open source external VMS/attack surface enumerator. 
- [OWASP Amass](https://github.com/OWASP/Amass) is also for enumerating attack surface.
- Rapid7 [Project Sonar](https://www.rapid7.com/research/project-sonar/) is scanning the internet and making the data available [here](https://opendata.rapid7.com).
- [Nuclei](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei) does non-invasive vulnerability testing.
- [GoPhish](https://getgophish.com) is an open source phishing simulation system. CISA has some [tools for working with it](https://github.com/cisagov/gophish-tools).
- [This presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/165aynAErTyYdymaoqwBuguVXJNia3CdqYSZiL6RJMPM/edit#slide=id.gd3ffd1da6a_0_124) is a useful intro to Velociraptor, an endpoint DFIR tool.
