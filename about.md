Simon is an information security strategist by day. His focus is on building stronger connections between classical information security practice and the strategy of the broader business. Most of his background is in working for financial services, because that's where some of the really interesting problems are. 

The views expressed here are entirely his own and are in no way endorsed by his employer.
