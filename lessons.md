As we charge through life, the universe often pauses us to teach us something important. Here are some insights from my path.

**First lesson:** Subjectivity is a lesser sin than false rigor.

**Second lesson:** In the absence of recurring audit, the permissions attached to an object relax toward “allow all” over time.

**Third lesson:** Bureaucratic processes are the aggregate result of someone asserting that “if I had signed off on process x, I could have prevented failure y” with little regard to the likelihood of the failure reoccurring.

**Fourth lesson:** A report is an interface between two processes, not an end point.

**Fifth lesson:** Abstraction (particularly generality) is powerful and expensive; be careful not to design things so powerful that you price yourself out of building them.

**Sixth lesson**: System stability automatically degrades when you're running a skeleton crew (e.g. over a significant holiday).
